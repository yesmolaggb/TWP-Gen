|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Status Diagnosis** | 1. Problem Definition & Current Overview: Use key indicators to outline the present situation, define analytical boundaries, and clarify the core issue.<br>2. Development Path Review: Trace major shifts and milestone events that shaped the current state.<br>3. Multi-Level Cause Analysis: Build a structured causal framework to explain the underlying drivers across different layers.<br>4. Empirical Validation: Use representative cases to substantiate causal logic and enhance credibility.<br>5. Trend Insights & Strategic Suggestions: Derive future trends from causal analysis and provide actionable strategic guidance. | When the background is already known, the development review can be omitted. If the focus is on solutions, start directly with cause analysis and recommendations. |
| **Evaluation & Forecasting** | 1. Framework Establishment: Define the objectives, scope, and evaluation criteria to form a baseline for analysis.<br>2. Comprehensive Assessment: Develop a multidimensional indicator system and perform comparative analysis to reach objective conclusions.<br>3. Scenario Modeling & Forecasting: Construct alternative development paths based on key variables and assess uncertainties.<br>4. Decision Recommendations: Translate predictive results into prioritized and actionable decision plans. | If only comparative findings are required, skip the framework setup. If forecasting is the main goal, begin with scenario modeling. |
| **Planning & Design** | 1. Goal Setting & Current Review: Clarify core goals and value orientation while taking stock of available resources.<br>2. Gap Identification & Needs Analysis: Compare current conditions against target requirements to pinpoint improvement priorities.<br>3. Task Breakdown & Implementation Planning: Translate objectives into executable tasks and outline the roadmap for delivery.<br>4. Risk Management & Safeguards: Identify major risks and design mitigation measures and contingency plans.<br>5. Monitoring & Iterative Optimization: Establish monitoring mechanisms and ensure continuous refinement. | If objectives are already clear, start with gap analysis. For execution-oriented work, begin with task planning. |
| **Information Mapping** | 1. Scope Definition & Criteria Setting: Specify collection boundaries, screening criteria, and presentation expectations.<br>2. Classification & Highlighting: Structure information by logical dimensions, emphasizing key facts and insights.<br>3. Supplementary Notes & Sources: Provide contextual explanations and cite reliable sources. | For basic compilations, classification may be omitted. For practical use, emphasize structured and navigable presentation. |
| **Comprehensive (Fallback) Analysis** | 1. Background & Core Proposition: Define the main issue and the intended outcome.<br>2. Evidence & Validation: Substantiate claims with data, theory, and case evidence.<br>3. Multi-Angle Argumentation: Examine the topic through multiple perspectives to build a cohesive line of reasoning.<br>4. Implementation Path & Risk Management: Present feasible action steps and address potential risks with countermeasures.<br>5. Conclusion & Actionable Insights: Synthesize findings into clear, practical recommendations. | The entry point can vary: start from the proposition for conclusion-driven work, from implementation for execution-focused work, or from argumentation for analysis-heavy studies. |""")}
